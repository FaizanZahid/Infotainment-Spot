Inspired from the idea of 9GAG and other fun promoting websites, I made this as a hobby project in my Human Computer Interaction Course.

Allows image processing operations right in your browser
Supports visually attractive things including:

* HTML5 Voice
* Zoom on image hover
* HTML5 Geocode API for finding where you are
* jQuery sliders
* Jokes
* Quotes
* Facts
* Health

The project size was pretty huge, that's why couldn't upload the files to repo.
Feel free to contact, if you want the source.
